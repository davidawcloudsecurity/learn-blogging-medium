## Framework for an Engaging Medium Introduction

Writing an attention-grabbing introduction on Medium is crucial for drawing readers in and setting the stage for your article. Here’s a proven framework and format you can use, tailored to your topic—*how to patch a Windows Server in an EC2 instance using only wget and DISM*:

**1. Start with a Hook**
- Use a provocative question, a surprising fact, or a bold statement to immediately catch the reader’s attention. For example, highlight a common frustration or risk that your target audience faces, or share an unexpected benefit of your approach[1][2][3].

**2. Set the Context**
- Briefly explain why the topic matters. Touch on the challenges of patching Windows servers in cloud environments, especially when traditional tools are unavailable or restricted. This shows empathy and relevance to your reader’s situation[1][2].

**3. Preview the Solution**
- Let readers know what they’ll learn and why your method is valuable. Mention that you’ll demonstrate a lightweight, scriptable approach using only `wget` and `dism`, and hint at the simplicity or reliability this brings[2][3].

**4. Establish Credibility or Relatability**
- Share a quick anecdote, your experience, or reference a common scenario (e.g., being locked out of Windows Update or lacking GUI access on a remote server). This builds trust and rapport[1][3].

**5. Smooth Transition**
- End your introduction with a sentence that naturally leads into the main content, signaling what comes next[3].
